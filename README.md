# Pave Challenge
The goal of this project is to help our client, The Restaurant Group, visualize pay differences among their employees. 

The web page shows charts comparing average salaries, bonuses, and total compensations between Gamine and Hookfish. Charts are grouped by categories such as employment type, department, level, and gender to show differences between the two companies with regard to these segments.

# Build Steps
Clone the repo.
`cd pave-challenge`
`npm start`

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the web app.

# Planned Features
Ideally, we could also use global filters on charts to dive deep into certain employmee segments (I ran out of time on this implementation).

Instead of the canned charts, it may be beneficial for the client to be able to create their own chart by picking categories, values, etc. 

Using `startDate` as a range filter could provide insights into when compensentation discrepancies started to occur, if any.
